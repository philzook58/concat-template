# concat-test
A basic repo with stack setup to use Conal Elliott's compiling to categories plugin
1. Add extra-deps to point to his repo
2. Add plugin and optimization ghc flags to package.yaml
3. import plugins

Changed the lts to one that uses ghc 8.0.2
I iteratively added extra-deps trying to get it to compile. I dunno.
